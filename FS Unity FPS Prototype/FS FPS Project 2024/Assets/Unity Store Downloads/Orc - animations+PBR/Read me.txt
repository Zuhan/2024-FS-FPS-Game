In folder "Textures" have customized materials, if the materials flew off, then you need to place the corresponding texture in each cell from the corresponding folder

If there are problems with Scale and dimensions you should change meaning "Scale factor" in tab "Model". Go to the folder "orc" -> choose model to be edited -> change "scale factor".
